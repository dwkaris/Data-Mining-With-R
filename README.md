*   Bivariate Analysis

3.  Splitting dataset into testing and training data

4.  Carry out classification while providing description of how each model differsand their limitation 

*   K-Mean Clustering
*   Hierarchical Clustering

5.  Make predictions using the different Models

6.  Access accuracy of different models

7.  Make conclusions & Challenge the solution
